JUNIT/Unit Testing





Hibernate ORM

I have continued learning about Hibernate this week and am starting to dive more into it. I created some different MYSQL tables called Employee and Department and have started to use JAVA Hibernate to manage them. In the code that I created I use @ManyToOne annotation which defines a single-valued association to another entity class that has many-to-one multiplicity. It is not normally necessary to specify the target entity explicitly since it can usually be inferred from the type of the object being referenced.

I also use @JoinColumn which is used to specify a mapped column for joining an entity association.

And I use @OneToMany annotation which defines a many-valued association with one-to-many multiplicity.
If the collection is defined using generics to specify the element type, the associated target entity type need not be specified; otherwise the target entity class must be specified.

The files for my code for this one can be found on my Github page at 


USE Case

This week I also took your advice and dove in a little deaper with my sequence diagrams. I created both a Use Case Diagram and a use case document. My use case diagram is a diagram of some code that creates an etch a sketch type box that you can write in. The diagram represents the user interactions among the elements in the system. I used lucid charts to create this as that is what my work uses so that is what I am most familiar with. I also created a document explaining the use cases and how the user would interact with the program. This is different then the diagram because it is written out where the diagram is just a graphical representation. 

The code used to create the diagram's can be found at https://github.com/coltonblair13/CIT360/blob/master/ControlPanelEtchASketch.java. The diagram can be found at https://github.com/coltonblair13/CIT360/blob/master/Appendix3%20-%20System%20Use%20Case.pdf. And the Description can be found at https://github.com/coltonblair13/CIT360/blob/master/Appendix%201%20-%20Use%20Case%20Descriptions.pdf. Both the diagram and the description are in PDF format. 

Thank you for your time and patience in helping me through this class. Let me know if you have any problems.
