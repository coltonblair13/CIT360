Model View Controller Pattern

This week I taught the model view controller pattern to my group during our group meeting. I covered most of this in the recording. It can be found on our group page at https://plus.google.com/communities/103827854741093694877 and my teaching starts at about the 14 minute mark for this topic. 

I also share some code that I have been working with. I created a modelviewcontrollerpattern folder out on my github that contains the code. What I did was create a student object acting as the model and a StudentView that will be the view class which will pring the student details on console and then a studentController which is the controller class responsible for storing the data in Student object and update view StudentView accordingly.

Each of these including the output can be found on my github at
